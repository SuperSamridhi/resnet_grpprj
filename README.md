This project is a recommendation system for fashion clothing made using ResNet or residual networks and KNN or K- nearest neighbours. 
We saw how CNN and its various types can be used to classify the image dataset and perceive the hidden patterns to train our model. 
We saw that the categories of fashion products depend on gender, season, etc. Of the 10 layers used in CNN, 9 are as they were, and the final layer is different i.e., 
the global max pooling 2D layer which is used for resizing thus making our work easier moreover images are easy to work with.
Then with the help of ResNet and KNN, we are getting the desired result. 
In conclusion, it is crucial to compare our picture-based strategy to other recommender frameworks to determine how well it serves clients.
